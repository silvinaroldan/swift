### Test

#### Advices
Tests should be sensitive to things that are important, but ignore things that are unimportant.  
Avoid Hardcoded values to cover hidden assumptions.  
The most important thing to do is make sure the code you’re testing relies solely on the input you’re providing.  

### ShortCuts

Cmd+U: Run all tests.  
Ctrl+Alt+Cmd+U: Run whichever test my text caret is currently in.  
Ctrl+Alt+Cmd+G: Run whichever test I last ran.
